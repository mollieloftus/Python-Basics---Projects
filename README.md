This is where you'll find my Python Basics Projects

🐍 Python Basics Projects
This repository contains the Python exercises I completed during my Data Technician bootcamp. These projects helped me learn the core building blocks of programming and get comfortable writing simple Python programs.

⭐ What I Learned
🔤 Variables
I practised storing information in variables so my programs could remember values and use them later.

🖨️ print() and input()
I used print() to show messages to the user and input() to ask questions and collect information.

🔄 Loops (for and while)
I learned how to repeat actions using for loops and while loops, which helped me automate tasks and work through lists or ranges of numbers.

🔀 If Statements
I used if, elif, and else to make decisions in my programs — for example, checking conditions and choosing what should happen next.

🔢 Type Casting
I practised converting between data types (like strings and numbers) so I could do calculations with user input.

🧩 What These Projects Show
These exercises demonstrate my ability to:

Build simple logic

Interact with users

Perform calculations

Write clear and organised Python code

They form the foundation for more advanced Python and data analysis work I’ll be doing next.
